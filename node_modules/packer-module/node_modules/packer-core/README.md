packer-core
===========
This npm project contains a generic script that dynamic loads grunt tasks and configurations to your project. Since grunt does not support inheritance of configuration from a parent it is not possible to reuse your build process for different projects. This library enables you to package your build process in a separate project and reuse it for multiple projects.
